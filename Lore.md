# Chapter 1 - Regions
There are two main regions in the game world. One is entirely controled by humans, the other, is home to all other races in the game. There are technological, geographical, and demographical differences between the two regions making the interactions between them more interesting.<br>
<br>

## 1.1 - The Continent
This is the planet's only continent. It is almost entirely covered in city. Buildings of different kinds spread as far as the eye can see. The sparse spots outside the cities are poorly managed farm fields, or what's left of them. The soil found on this landmass is unsuit to sustain any flora. It is extremely acidic, barely has any nutrients, and is contaminated with chemicals. This is why, while scarce amounts of crops can be seen growing on the continent, their volume and quality remains very low.<br>
<br>
The sky above the continent is grey and cloudy from the constant burning of fossil fuels needed to sustain the humanity's industries. When it rains, it rains acid, which helps further worsen the state of the landmass's soil. There are no birds or insects flying above the continent because of that.<br>
<br>
The waters around the continent are deep, devoid of life, and impossible to see through. On the surface, there are countless ships of predominantly two kinds; Warships and Cargo ships.<br>
<br>


## 1.2 - The Archipelago
<br>
This is the area referred to as "The Scattered Lands". It is an enormous archipelago situated a long way south of the continent; about a week's voyage if one relies on winds alone.<br>
<br>
The islands in this place are clean, lushous, and untarnished by the hand of man. The exact flora varies from island to island, but its state is uniformly well off. The soil is rich in nutrients, and free of any contaminants.<br>
<br>
The state and variety of the fauna varies from island to island as well; As a rule of thumb though, the farther away from Drakari, the more numerous and less dangerous the animal life is, as they can live and multiply uninterrupted.<br>
<br>
The climate in the islands is predominantly tropical. It is only disturbed by the largest of landmasses who can create their own little climates (such as the desert island). As such there are only two seasons; Dry season, which is characterized by very low humidity and intense sun and heat, and the monsoon season, which is characterized by extremely high humidity and rainfall, and little to no sun. The two happen cyclically with nothing in between (there's no winters).<br>
<br>
Gameplaywise, the archipelago will be divided into 9 zones. These are:

### 1.2.1 The Merfolk Region<br>

<br>
No landmasses can be found in this region. The horizon is jutted with several-stories-tall metal spires protruding from the surface of otherwise undisturbed waters. In the distance, black smoke with no clear origin can be observed. This region is home to Merfolk and a wide variety of aquatic life. While there isn't much on the surface, underwater there are many submarine features such as hydrothermal vents, underground caves and tunnels, wrecks and ruins, reefs, etc.<br>
<br>
The flora of this region includes seaweed, algae, kelp, and coral reef.<br>
<br>

### 1.2.2 The Elf & Dwarf Region<br>

<br>
This region is home to the most luscious of lands with the most arable of soils. The islands in this region are covered in thriving temperate flora. The fauna consists of nearly exclusively herbivores with few to no natural predators. Forests and valleys of these islands are populated with Elven communities, while the mountains are home to the dwarves. There is a sense of peace, harmony and stability in this region.<br>
<br>

### 1.2.3 The Drakaari Region<br>

<br>
This region is characterized by its volcanic activity. It is the only region in game that has volcanos, and all islands in this region are volcanic. The outskirts of the islands as well as any other spots with arable land, are densely packed with vibrant flowers that find the islands' soil's high acidity very accommodating. Apart from the flowers, not much else grows on these islands.<br>
<br>
The tops and cliffs of the volcanos are home to primitve Drakaari settlements, that are haphazardly built into the volcanic foundation. Apart from Drakaari, the sparse fauna on these islands consists of highly aggressive and very dangerous carnivores who are being hunted for sport by the Drakaari.<br>
<br>
This region's natural features include: lakes of magma, geysers, hot springs, acid lakes, and more.<br>
<br>

### 1.2.4 The Desert Island<br>

<br>
This is the largest island in the Scattered Lands. It is a vast expanse of mostly empty desert. The trend is only ocassionally broken by natural features such as rocks of sandstone, cliffs, oases, dried out lake and river banks, crude oil reservoirs, metal ores, and mysterious ruins. The climate of this island is arid and such, the flora consists of sparsely scattered cacti, aloe vera, agave, and palm trees.<br>
<br>
The fauna of this island consists of lizards, vultures, hyenas, scorpions, snakes, camels, foxes, boars, ostritches, and more. (Basically animals that don't expend too much energy but can go on for a long time in this harsh environment)<br>
<br>
The population of the island largely consists of outlaws of all different races. Those usually settle in remote and hard to access places where they build their huts. The remainder of the population consists of highly civilized citizens of the pyramid city, which is situated close to the island's center.<br>
<br>
Underground, there are enormous cave systems yet undiscovered housing all sorts of natural resources.<br>
<br>

### 1.2.5 The Pirate Island (and the sea of acid)<br>

<br>
This island is a result of a collosal battle that took place between fleets of outlaws and human navy. It lasted over a month, and over ten thousand ships were sunk and amassed to erect a monument of megalithic proportions, now called the "Pirate Island". This sea fortress is equipped with tens of thousands of cannons, making for an effective deterrent against the fleets of the navy. As such, it is home to many pirates, smugglers, traffickers, and the like, who are tired of running away from the law enforcement.<br>
<br>
There is no fauna found on the island; only criminals. Due to the extremely acidic environment, no flora can exist here either. It is a desolate fortress where all goods are stolen, imported, or both, which negatively reflects on the prices of said goods, making it so that only the richest of scum can afford to survive here.<br>
<br>
The water around the island is pure acid; only the toughest of metal ships can enter and survive. Fauna in these waters still isn't entirely uncovered, but there are rumors about some sort of big skeletal snake whose back arches over the surface of the water. People also report sighting large colourful orbs floating up from the surface of the water and into the sky.<br>
<br>


### 1.2.6 The Lizard Island<br>

<br>
The Lizard Island is the second largest landmass in the Scattered Lands. It has the humidest of climates, and the highest density of flora. It is largely covered by rainforest which harbors the most vibrant and diverse fauna found across the isles. The only sentient species that occupies the island is the Lizard, who had made the dark and dank undergrowth a perfect veil. They settle in small towns of mud huts arranged in such a way that the entire settlement resembles a ring, with a huge communal fire pit in the middle lit only for feasts and sacrifice.<br>
<br>
The flora of this island is extremely rich in variety across all stratas. Pretty much every species of plant imaginable grows somewhere on this island. As for fauna, it is incredibly diverse as well; insects flying and crawling, arachnids, birds, rodents, salamanders, felines, reptiles, and amphibians all alike, thrive in this environment.<br>
<br>
Natural features of this island's landscape include elements such as mangrove forests, overground and underwater caves, snags (areas of dead fauna), hills and mountains, waterfalls, rivers, lakes, and creeks and brooks.<br>
<br>

# Chapter 2 - Nations

<br>
Nations are the deciding entities in the game's political story.<br>
Formerly there were even more nations than there are races, however the sudden union and mobilization of humans forced a global shift on the world scene to the effect of there now being only two major sides in the conflict. These are:<br>
<br>

## 2.1 - Human nation

This nation is situated on the continent and has absolute control over it. It has been established relatively recently as the humanity's ditch attempt to regain stability through conquest of new land.<br>
<br>
Its population constist exclusively of humans who are the leader in the military technology. Given their historic involvement in warfare, they now control assets such as explosives, warships, armoured land vehicles, modern lightweight body armour, automatic rifles, or airborne vehicles. Needless to say, their military inventions are unmatched by any other nation.<br>
<br>
Their stake in the conflict is sustenance. Since their land is no longer suitable to sustain any flora (or fauna that feeds off it), they are forced to seek new land where the soil is still fertile.<br>
<br>
Knowing that they can't just get away with claiming any land they please, humans remain very hostile and aggressive, desperate to exterminate anyone in their way. They believe themselves to be the superior race made to rule over everyone else. This further worsens their reputation.<br>
<br>

## 2.2 - The United Forces of the Archipelago (UFA)

While not one nation, this region as a whole, sharing one common enemy, entered a union for the time of the war. Knowing their enemy's military advantage, their hopes are to utilize their defensive advantages to make this a war of attrition.<br>
<br>
Combining their discoveries, they collectively control such assets as early engine boats, sailboats, blackpowder, primitive firearms, various mounts, metal armour, swords, compact bows, and electricity. Due to the relatively recent establishment of the union however, these assets are not yet distributed properly.<br>
<br>
Luckily for the UFA, the environment in which they find themselves has some defensive advantages that the union is utilizing to the best of their ability. These are: Sea monsters, reefs, hydrothermal vents, wild land predators, places of shallow waters, whirlpools, lack of infrastructure, and powerful criminals roaming free.<br>
<br>
Their stake in the conflict is not only the defense of their motherland(s), but they're also opening themselves up for the opportunity to exterminate the terribly oppressive race of humans and restore the continent to its former natural glory under their government, which they believe is possible if the war remains in a deadlock for long enough.<br>
<br>


# Chapter 3 - Races

<br>
There are many different races in the game world. Some are intelligent and have long moved past hunting and gathering for survival, while others are primitive and rely on the nature's mercy, or in some cases, more intelligent races' mercy.<br>
<br>
Apart from humans who are intrinsically racist, the race is not a huge factor among the races of the scattered lands. While there may be humorous exchanges between different races such as dwarves and elves, there has not yet been any racial war or widespread condemnation against any particular race for the reason of race alone. If there is one, it's going to be incentivised by either a political or economical reason.<br>
<br>
When it comes to awareness, not all races are coaware which means they don't all know about each other's existence. Some races will want to remain unknown (e.g. Drakari), while others will want to meet and cooperate (e.g. Elves). This opens up opportunities for unique interactions such as exploitation or unknown conflicts.<br>
<br>



## 3.1 - Humans

Humans are native to the continent and have seen the green temperate climate and pristine terrain come and go as they developed over the many hundreds of years. Since the beginning, humans had taken advantage of the plentiful natural resources found all around them. While it allowed them to colonize the place en masse, it ultimately proved to be their undoing as wars broke out between the different settlements and quickly spiralled out of control, fueling military development for years to come. The conflicts went on for hundreds of years, leading humanity to a technological enlightenment, and the land in their wake, to devastation.<br>
<br>
Because of the degradation of their land, humans witnessed severe food shortages that ravished their economy. Many lives were lost, but eventually the remaining settlements signed a peace treaty and united. After long deliberation, the united nations of humans have come to the conclusion that the only way to save their falling nation is invasion on the lands yet unspoiled.<br>
<br>
This beast has neither fang nor claw. By themselves, they are exceptionaly fragile. Even in large numbers, their collective strength wouldn't stand a chance against a single Drakari. What makes humans special is their intelligence. With this trait alone, humans had managed to ascend to the top of the foodchain through their inventions. When properly equipped, a single human has the capacity of defeating a whole battalion of elves, outpacing a cheetah, or soaring higher than any bird ever could. Because of that, they deem themselves superior to other races, and fittingly, had called their united nation, the "Orbis Patria" (Latin for "The Homeland of The World").<br>
<br>
##### Unaware of: Drakari
##### Hates: everyone; 



## 3.2 - Merfolk (Mermaids)
Merfolk are a submarine species of human-fish hybrid. They are cetaceans. The top half of their body resembles human while the bottom resembles fish. Their bodies are almost entirely covered in bioluminescent blue and purple hued scales. The only area that isn't covered by scales is their face. Their arms and tails have fins and barbels. Their hands are webbed and topped with sharp claws. Their hair is tentacles?, and their noses are spire shaped rostrums.<br>
<br>
Despite their overwhelming resemblence to fish, Merfolk are an intelligent and social species with some human traits. They need air to survive, and so they have to reemerge once ever couple hours. Their speech aparatus doesn't work the same way as humans' or other likely bodied races, which is why Merfolk can only speak some elven due to the language's reliance on the clicking sound. Some elves also denote communicating with them via codes.<br>
<br>
Merfolk don't construct much except their own housing. They live in metal spires that stick out of the surface of the water several stories. Since they cannot process metal themselves, they trade with the elves. They exchange sea shells (fertilizer), corals and precious stones, seaweed and fish, in exchange for the building materials, weapons, and medicinal herbs.<br>
<br>

##### Unaware of: Dwarves, Drakari
##### Likes: Elves, Reptiles
##### Hates: Humans


## 3.3 - Drakari (Dragon people)
Drakari is an ancient race believed to be the descendants of dragons. While their exact origin remains unknown, drakari have found the islands quite accommodating of their affinity to fire. They build their settlements on the sides and tops of volcanos, living only in small tribes, and detached from the rest of the world. They show profound disinterest in anything related to science, instead opting for a more traditional way of life. Even though beast at heart, Drakari very rarely fight each other. They are however exceptionally aggressive towards anything that isn't one of them, and once they spot a target, they're willing to chase them for hours if they have to. Their simple animalistic brains simply refuse to let up.<br>
<br>
While they may not be very intelligent, Drakari compensate for that with brawn. Their physical strength is unmatched by any other race in the world. Even a toddler Drakari could tear a human limb from limb. This combined with their ability to breathe fire makes them terrifying opponents. It is perhaps a blessing then, that Drakari prefer to keep to their volcano tops, and far out of the valleys where societies prosper.<br>
<br>
Due to their strength, Drakari have no need for weapons, and even if given one, it is dubious whether they'd understand how to use it. They also wear no armour as they're not used to any kind of resistance from their prey. They tend to wear simple leathers and furs, strapped or tied tightly around their waists. Their heads have horns as reminders of their ancestry, and their hair is soot-black from the scorching heat of their environment.<br>
<br>

##### Indifferent to: Everyone

## 3.4 - Elves
Elves are a species of human-like creatures who occupy the forests and valleys of the scattered lands. Unlike humans, elves are faint of heart and believe that an intelligent beast should live in synergy with their surroundings. Enacting this view, Elves reside in trees, foxholes, and between the roots of the trees. Sometimes they share a place with other animals, and reward them for their hospitality with food and shiny trinkets. Elves only construct buildings that will benefit them all. No single elf is allowed private property.<br>
<br>
While their similarity to humans is quite stark, there are several key differences such as their sharpened senses, pointed ears, wide eyes, thin build, cat-like agility, and lightning speed.<br>
<br>
Elves are the leader in agricultural technology. Their ability to produce high volume of crops while maintaining the quality of soil is second to none. They perfectly understand the needs of both plants and the soil in which they grow, and are able to streamline the process with automation.<br>
<br>
Their economy is built on crop and animal produce. They produce so much food and herbs that they are able to export the majority of it to other nations. This is why public relations are so important to them. They maintain a good relationship with both Merfolk and Dwarves, and conduct trade regularly. They exchange medicinal herbs, barley, hops, textiles, livestock, food, and woodcraft for metal ingots, labour, electricity, mechanical components, building materials, and alcohol with Dwarves, and medicinal herbs, weapons and building materials for seashells (fertilizer), corals and precious stones, seaweed and fish with Merfolk.<br>
<br>
Being at the frontline of the new conflict, Elves are responsible for construction of military vessels for the islands' armies. They do so in cooperation with dwarven labourers and engineers. While far behind humans', their metal ships are still impressive. Apart from the ships, the engineering groups are prototyping with other types of vehicle as well to gain an edge in the conflict.<br>

## 3.5 - Dwarves
Dwarves are a peaceful race of social stubby creatures. They live together in great numbers, and are very accustomed to dealing with other races. They occupy underground regions where they carve their cities into the rocks around them. They are fantastic engineers and architects who expertly plan out every square inch to be as productive as possible. This allowed them to reach extreme population densities. Their ingenuity eventually lead them to discover a natural resource noone else had found before - electricity. They understood and implemented it immediately, spurring hundreds of inventions.<br>
<br>
Their cities, despite being entirely underground, are astonishing, picturesque showcase of their ingenious architectural craftsmanship. Their tall houses that stretch up vertically top to bottom are ornmented with all sorts of sculpted oddities from cultures unknown to an average layman. Their streets, flowing with relentless volume of dwarven populus, wind up and down and around the incredibly complex cave system, diverting foot traffic into the countless destinations in every direction. Besides the streets, and in places hard to access, lay mysterious machines performing all sorts of different functions. Their sewage system protects them from floods. Their tight corridors and defensive inlets are perfect compliment to their mastery of blade.
<br>
Dwarves rely on their relationship with Elves for sustenance of their massive population. Since they can't grow any plants underground (at least yet), they exchange what they produce for food, livestock, and alcohol ingredients. In recent years, it is thanks to that relationship that they launched a research project on the surface to help gain an edge in the rising conflict.<br>

## 3.6 - Reptiles
Reptiles are bipedal lizard-like humanoid beings. They share both reptile and primate traits. They have scales instead of skin whose colour they can change at will, long tails, and spikes lining their spines.<br>
<br>
They reside deep in the rainforest, and had observed the world around them since time forgotten (this is how they know of elves, but not the other way round).<br>
<br>
Among the intelligent beings, they are at the bottom. Their tribes are primal, their toools primitive, and their language simple. They reside in mud huts with leaf rooftops, build their settlements in rings, and conduct rituals to appease gods.<br>
<br>
Reptiles live the life of hunters. While they're omnivorous and could eat plants, they show a strong preference for meats. They usually hunt for small mammals, fish, insects, or amphibians, but there are records of groups of reptiles grouping up against larger prey.<br>
<br>
Due to their lifestile, Reptiles don't have a lot of free time, so the time they do have is spent on carving effigies, feasting, holding rituals, or other tribal ceremonies.<br>
<br>
A small percentage of Reptiles is born with gills. The reason for that is unknown, but nevertheless they are referred to as the "Amphmorphs", and given a special place in the society. Amphmorphs are tasked with hunting in the underwater regions and exchanging items with who they believe are gods, and who in reality, are just Merfolk taking advantage of the situation.<br>
<br>
Amphmorphs will exchange items such as their wooden effigies, different poisons found throghout the rainforest, various plant material, or carcusses for huge amounts of fish that hold very little value to Merfolk.<br>

# Chapter 4 - Characters
## 4.1 - Protagonist
The protagonist is a human born on the continent. When they were very young, their parents fled the continent to avoid starvation and left the child with Isidor and Isilda. Because of that, the child was brought up as an elf and now holds no semblance to humans. They play like an elf, speak like an elf, and have no memory of humans and their continent. They are entirely convinced of their elfhood.<br>
<br>
[this is where the player begins their game]<br>
<br>
After reaching adulthood, Isidor and Isilda explain to the protagonist that they're not really an elf.<br>
<br>
After hearing the truth, the protagonist decides to take to the sea in search of their parents. To do that, they are sent from one place to another throughout a questline, and eventually they stumble upon their parents' ship wreck washed ashore on some uninhabited island. Nearby the wreck are the corpses of Oskar and Barbara, with their hands tightly grasping a sheet of paper. Only once the protagonist decides to attempt to take the sheet, does their grasp weaken, revealing to the player their parent's last words. They were slain by humans.<br>
<br>
After reading the message, the player then spots a human vessel slowly approaching the island. It is at this point that the player can decide their fate. They can either sink the ship with a cannon (side with the isles), or wait for it to land (side with the humans). Either option will lead to a different storyline.<br>
<br>

## 4.2 - Isidor
Isidor is a male elf. He is 70 years old and happily married to his wife Isilda. He's the island's chief carpenter who had constructed many buildings for his community.<br>
<br>
38 years ago, Isidor and Isilda had met a pair of humans; Oskar and Barbara. The encounter was a very positive one, albeit short. The pairs exchanged their pasts and stories, and made lifelong impressions on each other, hoping to meet again one day.<br>
<br>
When a war errupted 20 years after the encounter, Isidor and Isilda unexpectedly stumbled upon a child in front of their olive tree. The child was human, and it had a note attached to it. The note was from Oskar and Barbara, and it informed the pair of their predicament, as well as their plans to flee in order to find a new home. Oskar and Barbara had asked the elven pair to watch after their kid until they've found a suitable place to stay. They promised they were going to be back in a month's time - that however, never happened.<br>
<br>
As months went by, the Elven pair realised that the humans may never come back. They understood that they cannot hide the child for ever, and having developed an emotional attachment to it, They crafted a pair of pointy ears and attached them over the child's own ears. This way, they could bring the child up as their own, disguising it as an elf.<br>
<br>


## 4.3 - Protagonist's Parents
The protagonist's parents; Oskar and Barbara, are humans born on the continent. Thanks to owning a seaside property, they were able to leave the continent's shores in secret on their small boat one day. They sailed around exploring the islands of the Scattered Lands, and made contact with Elves. While startled and fearful at first, the Elves' curiosity prevailed, and they welcomed the pair to the island. They offered their hospitality and showed them their Elven ways.<br>
<br>
In all of this, Oskar and Barbara managed to make friends with one pair of Elves in particular; Isidor and Isilda, who had shown enormous interest and child-like fascination with the continent. They invited the pair to their olive tree where they exchanged pasts, stories, and even items.<br>
<br>
When it was time to leave, The four of them waved each other goodbye, and promised to meet again one day.<br>
<br>
20 years later, when the conflict struck, Oskar and Barbara were among the first to experience the food shortages being situated in a remote countryside. After a long discussion and deliberation, they decided to take their child and move far away to the land of the Elves. Upon arriving however, they were met with hatred and aggression due to the war breaking out. Realizing their predicament, they decided to leave the kid in the wake of Isidor and Isilda's olive tree with a letter promising to return in a month's time. They planned to find a suitable place to settle, and then return for the kid. However, as months, and then years, passed by, there was no sign of Oskar or Barbara. They were dead.<br>
<br>


# Chapter 5 - Storylines
There are going to be 2 main storylines depending on whether the player sides with humans or the isles.

### 5.1 - Human storyline
If the player decides to side with humans, they will be issued a pardon from the captain of the ship, and will be taken acrew. They will then sail with the human fleet and sow destruction wherever they go. They will be given some of the conquered land as their stake in the war. They will also have the chance to use and craft humanity's inventions. 

### 5.2 - Isles Storyline
If the player decides to side with the isles, they will have sunk the ship and buried their chances of cooperation with humans. They will then be attacked on sight by
